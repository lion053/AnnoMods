# Downtown (Lion053)

## TL;DR

- This mod adds 3x3-sized building variations for public services, institutions, the post office and hotel.
- They are intended to be built in a block between residences to form a lively downtown or to cover small (leftover) areas where the larger original would be a waste of precious space.

## Properties

- Public service ranges are lower than their larger originals.
- Institutions have a slightly lower influence distance and you can only mobilize 2 instead of 3 special resolver units.
- The tiny hotel can accomodate 1/3 of the amount of tourists a vanilla hotel can accomodate.
- Construction and maintenance costs reflect their later unlocks
- All other values are inherited from their originals

## Menu

- "Engineer" category, next to Coffee chain
- "Public Services" category, next to Bank

## Unlock

- The unlock starts at 1.000 engineers for all building types which are originally available at this level. The others are unlocked when their original unlock conditions are met (e.g. bank at 3.000 engineers).
- For non-dlc owners, the hotel, post office and advanced institutions can be built as ornaments / skins.
